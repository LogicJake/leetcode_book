### 问题描述
Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.

Return the quotient after dividing `dividend` by `divisor`.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Note:**

	- Both dividend and divisor&nbsp;will be&nbsp;32-bit&nbsp;signed integers.
	- The divisor will never be 0.
	- Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [&minus;2<sup>31</sup>, &nbsp;2<sup>31</sup> &minus; 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 2<sup>31</sup> &minus; 1 when the division result&nbsp;overflows.
