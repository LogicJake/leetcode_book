### 问题描述
You are given `K` eggs, and you have access to a building with `N` floors from `1` to `N`.&nbsp;

Each egg is identical in function, and if an egg breaks, you cannot drop it&nbsp;again.

You know that there exists a floor `F` with `0 &lt;= F &lt;= N` such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than `F` will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor `F` will not break.

Each **move**, you may take an egg (if you have an unbroken one) and drop it from any floor `X` (with&nbsp;`1 &lt;= X &lt;= N`).&nbsp;

Your goal is to know&nbsp;**with certainty**&nbsp;what the value of `F` is.

What is the minimum number of moves that you need to know with certainty&nbsp;what `F` is, regardless of the initial value of `F`?

&nbsp;


**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Example 3:**

&nbsp;

**Note:**

	1. `1 &lt;= K &lt;= 100`
	1. `1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10000`
