### 问题描述
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., &nbsp;`[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]`&nbsp;might become &nbsp;`[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Note:**

	- This is a follow up problem to&nbsp;[Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/).
	- Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
