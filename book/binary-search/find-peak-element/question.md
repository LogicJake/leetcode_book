### 问题描述
A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Given an input array `nums`, where `nums[i] &ne; nums[i+1]`, find a peak element and return its index.

The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -&infin;`.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Note:**
