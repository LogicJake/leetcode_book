### 问题描述
Given an array of citations **sorted&nbsp;in ascending order **(each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher&#39;s h-index.

According to the&nbsp;[definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): &quot;A scientist has index&nbsp;*h*&nbsp;if&nbsp;*h*&nbsp;of his/her&nbsp;*N*&nbsp;papers have&nbsp;**at least**&nbsp;*h*&nbsp;citations each, and the other&nbsp;*N &minus; h*&nbsp;papers have&nbsp;**no more than**&nbsp;*h&nbsp;*citations each.&quot;

**Example:**

**Note:**

If there are several possible values for&nbsp;**h**, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

**Follow up:**

	- This is a follow up problem to&nbsp;[H-Index](/problems/h-index/description/), where `citations` is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
	- Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
