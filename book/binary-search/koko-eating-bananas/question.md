### 问题描述
Koko loves to eat bananas.&nbsp; There are `N`&nbsp;piles of bananas, the `i`-th&nbsp;pile has `piles[i]` bananas.&nbsp; The guards have gone and will come back in `H` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `K`.&nbsp; Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas, and eats K bananas from that pile.&nbsp; If the pile has less than `K` bananas, she eats all of them instead, and won&#39;t eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly, but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards come back.

Return the minimum integer `K` such that she can eat all the bananas within `H` hours.
