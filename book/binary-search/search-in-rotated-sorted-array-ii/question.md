What if *duplicates* are allowed?</p>

Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?


Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `0 1 2 4 5 6 7` might become `4 5 6 7 0 1 2`).

Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.

The array may contain duplicates.
