### 问题描述
Given an array of integers that is already ****sorted in ascending order****, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note:**

	- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
	- You may assume that each input would have **exactly** one solution and you may not use the **same** element twice.

**Example:**
