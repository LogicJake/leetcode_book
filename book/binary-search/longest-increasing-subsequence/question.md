### 问题描述
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example:**

**Note: **

	- There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
	- Your algorithm should run in O(*n<sup>2</sup>*) complexity.

**Follow up:** Could you improve it to O(*n* log *n*) time complexity?
