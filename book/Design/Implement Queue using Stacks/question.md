## Implement Queue using Stacks  
### 问题描述

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.
<ul>
<li>
push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
</li>
<li>
pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
</li>
<li>
peek() -- Get the front element.
</li>
<li>
empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
</li>
</ul>
**Notes:**<br>
<ul>
- You must use *only* standard operations of a stack -- which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
- You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).
