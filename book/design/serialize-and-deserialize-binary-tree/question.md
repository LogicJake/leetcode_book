### 问题描述
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Example:&nbsp;**

**Clarification:** The above format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](/faq/#binary-tree). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

**Note:&nbsp;**Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
