### 问题描述

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).



For example,<br />
**S** = `"ADOBECODEBANC"`<br />
**T** = `"ABC"`<br />



Minimum window is `"BANC"`.



**Note:**<br />
If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string `""`.



If there are multiple such windows, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.
