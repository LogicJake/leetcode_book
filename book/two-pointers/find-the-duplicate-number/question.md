### 问题描述
Given an array *nums* containing *n* + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and *n* (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Note:**

	1. You **must not** modify the array (assume the array is read only).
	1. You must use only constant, *O*(1) extra space.
	1. Your runtime complexity should be less than **O**(**n**<sup>2</sup>).
	1. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
