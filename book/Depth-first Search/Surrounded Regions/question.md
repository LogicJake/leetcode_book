

Given a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'` (the **letter** O), capture all regions surrounded by `'X'`.

A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.



For example,<br />
<pre>
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
</pre>



After running your function, the board should be:
<pre>
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
</pre>
