## Combination Sum  
### 问题描述

Given a **set** of candidate numbers (***C***) **(without duplicates)** and a target number (***T***), find all unique combinations in ***C*** where the candidate numbers sums to ***T***. 


The **same** repeated number may be chosen from ***C*** unlimited number of times.


**Note:**<br />
<ul>
- All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
</ul>



For example, given candidate set `[2, 3, 6, 7]` and target `7`, <br />
A solution set is: <br />
<pre>
[
  [7],
  [2, 2, 3]
]
</pre>
