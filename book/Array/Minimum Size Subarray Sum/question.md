## Minimum Size Subarray Sum  
### 问题描述

Given an array of **n** positive integers and a positive integer **s**, find the minimal length of a **contiguous** subarray of which the sum &ge; **s**. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.



For example, given the array `[2,3,1,2,4,3]` and `s = 7`,<br />
the subarray `[4,3]` has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

If you have figured out the *O*(*n*) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is *O*(*n* log *n*).
