### 问题描述
**This question is the same as &quot;Max Chunks to Make Sorted&quot; except the integers of the given array are not necessarily distinct, the input array could be up to length `2000`, and the elements could be up to `10**8`.**

Given an array `arr` of integers (**not necessarily distinct**), we split the array into some number of &quot;chunks&quot; (partitions), and individually sort each chunk.&nbsp; After concatenating them,&nbsp;the result equals the sorted array.

What is the most number of chunks we could have made?

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Note:**

	- `arr` will have length in range `[1, 2000]`.
	- `arr[i]` will be an integer in range `[0, 10**8]`.
