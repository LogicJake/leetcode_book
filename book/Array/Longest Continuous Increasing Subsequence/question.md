### 问题描述

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest `continuous` increasing subsequence (subarray).


**Example 1:**<br />
<pre>
**Input:** [1,3,5,4,7]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
</pre>


**Example 2:**<br />
<pre>
**Input:** [2,2,2,2,2]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 
</pre>


**Note:**
Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.
