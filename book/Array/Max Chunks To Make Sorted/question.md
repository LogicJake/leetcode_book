
Given an array `arr` that is a permutation of `[0, 1, ..., arr.length - 1]`, we split the array into some number of &quot;chunks&quot; (partitions), and individually sort each chunk.&nbsp; After concatenating them,&nbsp;the result equals the sorted array.

What is the most number of chunks we could have made?

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Note:**

	- `arr` will have length in range `[1, 10]`.
	- `arr[i]` will be a permutation of `[0, 1, ..., arr.length - 1]`.
