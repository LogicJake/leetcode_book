### 问题描述
Design a class to find&nbsp;the **k**th largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Your&nbsp;`KthLargest`&nbsp;class will have a constructor which accepts an integer `k` and an integer array `nums`, which contains initial elements from&nbsp;the stream. For each call to the method `KthLargest.add`, return the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.

**Example:**

**Note: **<br />
You may assume that&nbsp;`nums`&#39; length&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;`k-1`&nbsp;and `k` &ge;&nbsp;1.
