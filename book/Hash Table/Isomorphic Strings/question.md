### 问题描述
Given two strings ***s*** and ***t***, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in ***s*** can be replaced to get ***t***.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

For example,<br>
Given `"egg"`, `"add"`, return true.

Given `"foo"`, `"bar"`, return false.

Given `"paper"`, `"title"`, return true.

**Note:**<br>
You may assume both ***s*** and ***t*** have the same length.
