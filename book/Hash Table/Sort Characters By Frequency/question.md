
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
**Input:**
"tree"

**Output:**
"eert"

**Explanation:**
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**
<pre>
**Input:**
