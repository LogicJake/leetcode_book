
Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space, return whether the four points could construct a square.

The coordinate (x,y) of a point is represented by an integer array with two integers.

**Example:**<br />
<pre>
**Input:** p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,1]
**Output:** True
</pre>


 Note: 
<ol>
- All the input integers are in the range [-10000, 10000].
- A valid square has four equal sides with positive length and four equal angles (90-degree angles).
- Input points have no order.
