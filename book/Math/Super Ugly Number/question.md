## Super Ugly Number  
### 问题描述

    Write a program to find the n<sup>th</sup> super ugly number.



    Super ugly numbers are positive numbers whose all prime factors are in the given prime list
    `primes` of size `k`. For example, <code>[1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 19, 26, 28, 32]
</code> is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given `primes`
    = `[2, 7, 13, 19]` of size 4.



    **Note:**<br/>
    (1) `1` is a super ugly number for any given `primes`.<br/>
    (2) The given numbers in `primes` are in ascending order.<br/>
    (3) 0 < `k` &le; 100, 0 < `n` &le; 10<sup>6</sup>, 0 < `primes[i]` < 1000.<br />
    (4) The n<sup>th</sup> super ugly number is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.
