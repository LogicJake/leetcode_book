

Write a program to find the `n`-th ugly number.



Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`. For example, `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12` is the sequence of the first `10` ugly numbers.



Note that `1` is typically treated as an ugly number, and *n* **does not exceed 1690**.
