## Permutation Sequence  
### 问题描述
The set `[1,2,3,&#8230;,*n*]` contains a total of *n*! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,<br />
We get the following sequence (ie, for *n* = 3):
<ol>
- `"123"`
- `"132"`
- `"213"`
- `"231"`
- `"312"`
- `"321"`
</ol>


Given *n* and *k*, return the *k*<sup>th</sup> permutation sequence.

**Note:** Given *n* will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
