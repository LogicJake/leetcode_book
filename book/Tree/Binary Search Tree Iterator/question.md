### 问题描述
Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.

Calling `next()` will return the next smallest number in the BST.

**Note: **`next()` and `hasNext()` should run in average O(1) time and uses O(*h*) memory, where *h* is the height of the tree.
