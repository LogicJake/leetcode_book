

Given two non-empty binary trees **s** and **t**, check whether tree **t** has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of **s**. A subtree of **s** is a tree consists of a node in **s** and all of this node's descendants. The tree **s** could also be considered as a subtree of itself.


**Example 1:**<br>

Given tree s:
<pre>
     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
</pre>
Given tree t:
<pre>
   4 
  / \
 1   2
</pre>
Return **true**, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree of s.


**Example 2:**<br>

Given tree s:
<pre>
     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
    /
   0
</pre>
Given tree t:
<pre>
   4
  / \
 1   2
</pre>
Return **false**.
