### 问题描述
The set `[1,2,3,...,**n**]` contains a total of **n**! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for **n** = 3:

	1. `&quot;123&quot;`
	1. `&quot;132&quot;`
	1. `&quot;213&quot;`
	1. `&quot;231&quot;`
	1. `&quot;312&quot;`
	1. `&quot;321&quot;`

Given **n** and **k**, return the **k**<sup>th</sup> permutation sequence.

**Note:**

	- Given **n** will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
	- Given&nbsp;**k**&nbsp;will be between 1 and **n**! inclusive.

**Example 1:**
