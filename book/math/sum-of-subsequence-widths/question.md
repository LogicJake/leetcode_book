### 问题描述
Given an array of integers `A`, consider all non-empty subsequences of `A`.

For any sequence S, let the&nbsp;**width**&nbsp;of S be the difference between the maximum and minimum element of S.

Return the sum of the widths of all subsequences of A.&nbsp;

As the answer may be very large, **return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7**.

&nbsp;

**Example 1:**

&nbsp;

**Note:**

	- `1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 20000`
	- `1 &lt;= A[i] &lt;= 20000`
