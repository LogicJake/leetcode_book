### 问题描述
On a 2 dimensional grid with `R` rows and `C` columns, we start at `(r0, c0)` facing east.

Here, the north-west corner of the grid is at the&nbsp;first row and column, and the south-east corner of the grid is at the last row and column.

Now, we walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid.&nbsp;

Whenever we would move outside the boundary of the grid, we continue our walk outside the grid (but may return to the grid boundary later.)&nbsp;

Eventually, we reach all `R * C` spaces of the grid.

Return a list of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order they were visited.

&nbsp;

**Example 1:**

&nbsp;

**Example 2:**

**Note:**

	1. `1 &lt;= R &lt;= 100`
	1. `1 &lt;= C &lt;= 100`
	1. `0 &lt;= r0 &lt; R`
	1. `0 &lt;= c0 &lt; C`
