### 问题描述
On a&nbsp;`N&nbsp;*&nbsp;N` grid, we place some&nbsp;`1 * 1 * 1&nbsp;`cubes that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes.

Each value&nbsp;`v = grid[i][j]`&nbsp;represents a tower of&nbsp;`v`&nbsp;cubes placed on top of grid cell `(i, j)`.

Now we view the&nbsp;**projection**&nbsp;of these cubes&nbsp;onto the xy, yz, and zx planes.

A projection is like a shadow, that&nbsp;maps our 3 dimensional figure to a 2 dimensional plane.&nbsp;

Here, we are viewing the &quot;shadow&quot; when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.

Return the total area of all three projections.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Example 3:**

**Example 4:**

**Example 5:**

&nbsp;

**Note:**

	- `1 &lt;= grid.length = grid[0].length&nbsp;&lt;= 50`
	- `0 &lt;= grid[i][j] &lt;= 50`
