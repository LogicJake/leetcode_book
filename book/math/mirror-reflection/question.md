### 问题描述
There is&nbsp;a special square room with mirrors on each of the four&nbsp;walls.&nbsp; Except for the southwest&nbsp;corner, there are receptors on each of the remaining corners, numbered `0`, `1`, and `2`.

The square room has walls of length `p`, and a laser ray from the southwest corner&nbsp;first meets the east wall at a distance `q`&nbsp;from the `0`th receptor.

Return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.&nbsp; (It is guaranteed that the ray will meet&nbsp;a receptor eventually.)

&nbsp;

**Example 1:**

**Note:**

	1. `1 &lt;= p &lt;= 1000`
	1. `0 &lt;= q &lt;= p`
