### 问题描述
An N x N `board` contains only `0`s and `1`s. In each move, you can swap any 2 rows with each other, or any 2 columns with each other.

What is the minimum number of moves to transform the board into a &quot;chessboard&quot; - a board where no `0`s and no `1`s are 4-directionally adjacent? If the task is impossible, return -1.

**Note:**

	- `board` will have the same number of rows and columns, a number in the range `[2, 30]`.
	- `board[i][j]` will be only `0`s or `1`s.
