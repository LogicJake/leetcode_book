### 问题描述
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Example 3:**

**Note:**<br />
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [&minus;2<sup>31</sup>,&nbsp; 2<sup>31&nbsp;</sup>&minus; 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
