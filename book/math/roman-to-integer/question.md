### 问题描述
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols:&nbsp;`I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

For example,&nbsp;two is written as `II`&nbsp;in Roman numeral, just two one&#39;s added together. Twelve is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X` + `II`. The number twenty seven is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

	- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.&nbsp;
	- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.&nbsp;
	- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.
