### 问题描述
Find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to `N`.

Recall that a&nbsp;number is **prime** if it&#39;s only divisors are 1 and itself, and it is greater than 1.&nbsp;

For example, 2,3,5,7,11 and 13 are&nbsp;primes.

Recall that a number is a **palindrome** if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.&nbsp;

For example, 12321 is a palindrome.

&nbsp;

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Example 3:**

&nbsp;

**Note:**

	- `1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^8`
	- The answer is guaranteed to exist and be less than `2 * 10^8`.
