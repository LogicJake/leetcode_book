## Basic Calculator II  
### 问题描述
Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only **non-negative** integers, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators and empty spaces ` `. The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid.

Some examples:<br>
<pre>
"3+2*2" = 7
" 3/2 " = 1
" 3+5 / 2 " = 5
</pre>



**Note:** **Do not** use the `eval` built-in library function.
