## Compare Version Numbers  
### 问题描述
Compare two version numbers *version1* and *version2*.<br />
If *version1* &gt; *version2* return 1, if *version1* &lt; *version2* return -1, otherwise return 0.

You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the `.` character.<br />
The `.` character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.<br />
For instance, `2.5` is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.

Here is an example of version numbers ordering:
