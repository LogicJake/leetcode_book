## Repeated String Match  
### 问题描述
Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.


For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab". 


Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").


**Note:**<br />
The length of `A` and `B` will be between 1 and 10000.
