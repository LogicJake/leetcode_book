### 问题描述
Given a binary search tree, write a function `kthSmallest` to find the **k**th smallest element in it.

**Note: **<br>
You may assume k is always valid, 1 &le; k &le; BST's total elements.

**Follow up:**<br>
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
