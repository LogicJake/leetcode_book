### 问题描述
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Note:**

	- Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
	- The result can be in any order.

**Follow up:**

	- What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
	- What if *nums1*&#39;s size is small compared to *nums2*&#39;s size? Which algorithm is better?
	- What if elements of *nums2* are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
