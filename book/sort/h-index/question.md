Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher&#39;s h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): &quot;A scientist has index *h* if *h* of his/her *N* papers have **at least** *h* citations each, and the other *N &minus; h* papers have **no more than** *h* citations each.&quot;

**Example:**

**Note:&nbsp;**If there are several possible values for **h**, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
