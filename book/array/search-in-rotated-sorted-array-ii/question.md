### 问题描述
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,0,1,2,2,5,6]` might become `[2,5,6,0,0,1,2]`).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Follow up:**

	- This is a follow up problem to&nbsp;[Search in Rotated Sorted Array](/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/), where `nums` may contain duplicates.
	- Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
