### 问题描述
A 3 x 3 magic square is a 3 x 3 grid filled with distinct numbers **from 1 to 9** such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum.

Given an `grid`&nbsp;of integers, how many 3 x 3 &quot;magic square&quot; subgrids are there?&nbsp; (Each subgrid is contiguous).

&nbsp;

**Example 1:**

**Note:**

	1. `1 &lt;= grid.length&nbsp;&lt;= 10`
	1. `1 &lt;= grid[0].length&nbsp;&lt;= 10`
	1. `0 &lt;= grid[i][j] &lt;= 15`
