### 问题描述
Given an array `nums` of **n** integers where **n** &gt; 1, &nbsp;return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

**Example:**

**Note: **Please solve it **without division** and in O(**n**).

Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
