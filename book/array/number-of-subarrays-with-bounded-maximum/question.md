### 问题描述
We are given an array `A` of positive integers, and two positive integers `L` and `R` (`L &lt;= R`).

Return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) subarrays such that the value of the maximum array element in that subarray is at least `L` and at most `R`.

**Note:**

	- L, R&nbsp; and `A[i]` will be an integer in the range `[0, 10^9]`.
	- The length of `A` will be in the range of `[1, 50000]`.
