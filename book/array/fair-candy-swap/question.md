### 问题描述
Alice and Bob have candy bars of different sizes: `A[i]` is the size of the `i`-th bar of candy that Alice has, and `B[j]` is the size of the `j`-th bar of candy that Bob has.

Since they are friends, they would like to exchange one candy bar each so that after the exchange, they both have the same total&nbsp;amount of candy.&nbsp; (**The total amount of candy&nbsp;a person has is the sum of the sizes of candy&nbsp;bars they have.**)

Return an integer array `ans`&nbsp;where `ans[0]` is the size of the candy bar that Alice must exchange, and `ans[1]` is the size of the candy bar that Bob must exchange.

If there are multiple answers, you may return any one of them.&nbsp; It is guaranteed an answer exists.

**Note:**

	- `1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 10000`
	- `1 &lt;= B.length &lt;= 10000`
	- `1 &lt;= A[i] &lt;= 100000`
	- `1 &lt;= B[i] &lt;= 100000`
