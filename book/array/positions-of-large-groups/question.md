### 问题描述
In a string&nbsp;`S`&nbsp;of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.

For example, a string like `S = &quot;abbxxxxzyy&quot;` has the groups `&quot;a&quot;`, `&quot;bb&quot;`, `&quot;xxxx&quot;`, `&quot;z&quot;` and&nbsp;`&quot;yy&quot;`.

Call a group **large** if it has 3 or more characters.&nbsp; We would like the starting and ending positions of every large group.

The final answer should be in lexicographic order.

&nbsp;

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Example 3:**

&nbsp;

**Note:&nbsp;**&nbsp;`1 &lt;= S.length &lt;= 1000`
