### 问题描述
Given an array of integers where 1 &le; a[i] &le; *n* (*n* = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, *n*] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(*n*) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

**Example:**
<pre>
**Input:**
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

**Output:**
[5,6]
</pre>
