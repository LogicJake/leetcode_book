### 问题描述
Given an array `A`, partition it&nbsp;into two (contiguous) subarrays&nbsp;`left`&nbsp;and `right`&nbsp;so that:

	- Every element in `left`&nbsp;is less than or equal to every element in `right`.
	- `left` and `right` are non-empty.
	- `left`&nbsp;has the smallest possible size.

Return the **length** of `left` after such a partitioning.&nbsp; It is guaranteed that such a partitioning exists.

&nbsp;

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

&nbsp;

**Note:**

	1. `2 &lt;= A.length&nbsp;&lt;= 30000`
	1. `0 &lt;= A[i] &lt;= 10^6`
	1. It is guaranteed there is at least one way to partition `A` as described.
