### 问题描述
You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

**Example:**

**Explanation for the above example:**

Given the following multilevel doubly linked list:

<img src="/static/images/problemset/MultilevelLinkedList.png" style="height:50%; width:50%" />

We should return the following flattened doubly linked list:

<img src="/static/images/problemset/MultilevelLinkedListFlattened.png" style="height:90%; width:90%" />
