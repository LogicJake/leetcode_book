### 问题描述
In a given 2D binary array `A`, there are two islands.&nbsp; (An island is a 4-directionally connected group of&nbsp;`1`s not connected to any other 1s.)

Now, we may change `0`s to `1`s so as to connect the two islands together to form 1 island.

Return the smallest number of `0`s that must be flipped.&nbsp; (It is guaranteed that the answer is at least 1.)

&nbsp;

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Example 3:**

&nbsp;

**Note:**

	1. `1 &lt;= A.length =&nbsp;A[0].length &lt;= 100`
	1. `A[i][j] == 0` or `A[i][j] == 1`
