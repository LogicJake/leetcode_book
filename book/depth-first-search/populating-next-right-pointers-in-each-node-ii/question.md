### 问题描述
Given a binary tree

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Note:**

	- You may only use constant extra space.
	- Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

**Example:**

Given the following binary tree,

After calling your function, the tree should look like:
