### 问题描述
Given a 2D board containing `&#39;X&#39;` and `&#39;O&#39;` (**the letter O**), capture all regions surrounded by `&#39;X&#39;`.

A region is captured by flipping all `&#39;O&#39;`s into `&#39;X&#39;`s in that surrounded region.

**Example:**

After running your function, the board should be:

**Explanation:**

Surrounded regions shouldn&rsquo;t be on the border, which means that any `&#39;O&#39;`&nbsp;on the border of the board are not flipped to `&#39;X&#39;`. Any `&#39;O&#39;`&nbsp;that is not on the border and it is not connected to an `&#39;O&#39;`&nbsp;on the border will be flipped to `&#39;X&#39;`. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
