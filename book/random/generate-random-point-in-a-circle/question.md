### 问题描述
Given the radius and x-y positions of the center of a circle, write a function `randPoint`&nbsp;which&nbsp;generates a uniform random&nbsp;point in the circle.

Note:

	1. input and output values are&nbsp;in&nbsp;[floating-point](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/F/floating_point_number.html).
	1. radius and x-y position of the center of the circle is passed into the class constructor.
	1. a point on the circumference of the circle is considered to be&nbsp;in the circle.
	1. `randPoint`&nbsp;returns&nbsp;a size 2 array containing x-position and y-position of the random point, in that order.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Explanation of Input Syntax:**

The input is two lists:&nbsp;the subroutines called&nbsp;and their&nbsp;arguments.&nbsp;`Solution`&#39;s&nbsp;constructor has three arguments, the radius, x-position of the center, and y-position of the center of the circle. `randPoint` has no arguments.&nbsp;Arguments&nbsp;are&nbsp;always wrapped with a list, even if there aren&#39;t any.
