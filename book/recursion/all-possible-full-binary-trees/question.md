### 问题描述
A **full binary tree**&nbsp;is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2&nbsp;children.

Return a list of all possible full binary trees with `N` nodes.&nbsp; Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree.

Each `node` of each&nbsp;tree in the answer **must** have `node.val = 0`.

You may return the final list of trees in any order.

&nbsp;

**Example 1:**

&nbsp;

**Note:**

	- `1 &lt;= N &lt;= 20`
