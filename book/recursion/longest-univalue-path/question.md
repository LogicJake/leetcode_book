### 问题描述
Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.

**Note:** The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.


**Example 1:**



Input:
<pre>
              5
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          1   1   5
</pre>



Output:
<pre>
2
</pre>



**Example 2:**



Input:
<pre>
              1
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          4   4   5
</pre>



Output:
<pre>
2
</pre>


**Note:**
The given binary tree has not more than 10000 nodes.  The height of the tree is not more than 1000.
