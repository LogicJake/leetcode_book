## Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones  
### 问题描述
Given a positive integer n, find the number of **non-negative** integers less than or equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain **consecutive ones**.

**Example 1:**<br />
<pre>
**Input:** 5
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** 
Here are the non-negative integers <= 5 with their corresponding binary representations:
0 : 0
1 : 1
2 : 10
3 : 11
4 : 100
5 : 101
Among them, only integer 3 disobeys the rule (two consecutive ones) and the other 5 satisfy the rule.

**Note:**
1 <= n <= 10<sup>9</sup>
