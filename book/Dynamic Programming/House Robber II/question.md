### 问题描述
**Note:** This is an extension of [House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/).

After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself a new place for his thievery so that he will not get too much attention. This time, all houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, the security system for these houses remain the same as for those in the previous street. 

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.
