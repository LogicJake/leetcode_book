

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.



For example,<br />
Given `[10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]`,<br />
The longest increasing subsequence is `[2, 3, 7, 101]`, therefore the length is `4`. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.



Your algorithm should run in O(*n<sup>2</sup>*) complexity.


**Follow up:** Could you improve it to O(*n* log *n*) time complexity?
