### 问题描述
Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

**Example 1:**<br />
Given the list `[[1,1],2,[1,1]]`,
<p>
By calling *next* repeatedly until *hasNext* returns false, the order of elements returned by *next* should be: `[1,1,2,1,1]`.


**Example 2:**<br />
Given the list `[1,[4,[6]]]`,
<p>
By calling *next* repeatedly until *hasNext* returns false, the order of elements returned by *next* should be: `[1,4,6]`.
