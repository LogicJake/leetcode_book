### 问题描述
Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.

	- push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
	- pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
	- top() -- Get the top element.
	- empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.

**Example:**

**Notes:**

	- You must use *only* standard operations of a queue -- which means only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
	- Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.
	- You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).
