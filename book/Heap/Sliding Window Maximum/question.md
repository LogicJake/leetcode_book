
Given an array *nums*, there is a sliding window of size *k* which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the *k* numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

For example,<br>
Given *nums* = `[1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7]`, and *k* = 3.

Therefore, return the max sliding window as `[3,3,5,5,6,7]`.

**Note: **<br>
You may assume *k* is always valid, ie: 1 &le; k &le; input array's size for non-empty array.

Could you solve it in linear time?
