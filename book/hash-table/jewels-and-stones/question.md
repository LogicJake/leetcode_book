### 问题描述
You&#39;re given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S` representing the stones you have.&nbsp; Each character in `S` is a type of stone you have.&nbsp; You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in `J` are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so `&quot;a&quot;` is considered a different type of stone from `&quot;A&quot;`.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Note:**

	- `S` and `J` will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
	- The characters in `J` are distinct.
