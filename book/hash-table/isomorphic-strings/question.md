### 问题描述
Given two strings ***s*** and ***t***, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in ***s*** can be replaced to get ***t***.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Example 3:**

**Note:**<br />
You may assume both ***s&nbsp;***and ***t&nbsp;***have the same length.
