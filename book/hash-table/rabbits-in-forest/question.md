### 问题描述
In a forest, each rabbit has some color. Some subset of rabbits (possibly all of them) tell you how many other rabbits have the same color as them. Those `answers` are placed in an array.

Return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.

**Note:**

	1. `answers` will have length at most `1000`.
	1. Each `answers[i]` will be an integer in the range `[0, 999]`.
