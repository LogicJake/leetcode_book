### 问题描述
We define a harmonious array is an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly** 1.

Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible [subsequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence).

**Example 1:**<br />
<pre>
**Input:** [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
</pre>


**Note:**
The length of the input array will not exceed 20,000.
