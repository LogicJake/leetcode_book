### 问题描述
We have a two dimensional matrix&nbsp;`A` where each value is `0` or `1`.

A move consists of choosing any row or column, and toggling each value in that row or column: changing all `0`s to `1`s, and all `1`s to `0`s.

After making any number of moves, every row of this matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.

Return the highest possible&nbsp;score.

&nbsp;


**Example 1:**

&nbsp;

**Note:**

	1. `1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 20`
	1. `1 &lt;= A[0].length &lt;= 20`
	1. `A[i][j]`&nbsp;is `0` or `1`.
