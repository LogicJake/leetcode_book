### 问题描述
There are **N** gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station **i** is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station **i** to its next station (**i**+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station&#39;s index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

**Note:**

	- If there exists a&nbsp;solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
	- Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
	- Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**
