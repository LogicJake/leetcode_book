### 问题描述
At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs `$5`.&nbsp;

Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (in the order specified by `bills`).

Each customer will only buy one lemonade and&nbsp;pay with either a `$5`, `$10`, or `$20` bill.&nbsp; You must provide the correct change to each customer, so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you don&#39;t have any change&nbsp;in hand at first.

Return `true`&nbsp;if and only if you can provide every customer with correct change.

&nbsp;

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Example 3:**

**Example 4:**

&nbsp;

**Note:**

	- `0 &lt;= bills.length &lt;= 10000`
	- `bills[i]`&nbsp;will be either&nbsp;`5`, `10`, or `20`.
