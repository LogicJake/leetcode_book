### 问题描述

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.



For example,<br />
Given `1->2->3->4`, you should return the list as `2->1->4->3`.



Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may **not** modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.
