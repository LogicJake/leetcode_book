## Valid Palindrome  
### 问题描述

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.



For example,<br />
`"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"` is a palindrome.<br />
`"race a car"` is *not* a palindrome.



**Note:**<br />
Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.


For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.
