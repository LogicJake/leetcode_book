
Given *n* non-negative integers *a<sub>1</sub>*, *a<sub>2</sub>*, ..., *a<sub>n</sub>*, where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *a<sub>i</sub>*). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at (*i*, *a<sub>i</sub>*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.


Note: You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.
