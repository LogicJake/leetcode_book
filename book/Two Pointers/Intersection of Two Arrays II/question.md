

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.


**Example:**<br />
Given *nums1* = `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, *nums2* = `[2, 2]`, return `[2, 2]`.


**Note:**<br />
<ul>
- Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
- The result can be in any order.
</ul>


**Follow up:**<br />
<ul>
- What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
- What if *nums1*'s size is small compared to *nums2*'s size? Which algorithm is better?
- What if elements of *nums2* are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
</ul>
