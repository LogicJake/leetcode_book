

Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appear only *once* and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.


**Example:**
<pre>
Given *nums* = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of *nums* being 1 and 2 respectively.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
