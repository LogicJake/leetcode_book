### 问题描述
Follow up for problem "*Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node*".

What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?


**Note:**
- You may only use constant extra space.



For example,<br />
Given the following binary tree,<br />
<pre>
         1
       /  \
      2    3
     / \    \
    4   5    7
</pre>



After calling your function, the tree should look like:<br />
<pre>
         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 3 -> NULL
     / \    \
    4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
</pre>
