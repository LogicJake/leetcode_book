### 问题描述
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): &ldquo;The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p&nbsp;and q&nbsp;as the lowest node in T that has both p&nbsp;and q&nbsp;as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).&rdquo;

Given the following binary tree:&nbsp; root =&nbsp;[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Note:**

	- All of the nodes&#39; values will be unique.
	- p and q are different and both values will&nbsp;exist in the binary tree.
