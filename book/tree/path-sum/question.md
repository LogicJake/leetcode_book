### 问题描述
Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

**Note:**&nbsp;A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,

return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path `5-&gt;4-&gt;11-&gt;2` which sum is 22.
