### 问题描述

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.



According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”



For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes `2` and `8` is `6`. Another example is LCA of nodes `2` and `4` is `2`, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
