### 问题描述
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): &ldquo;The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q&nbsp;as the lowest node in T that has both p and q&nbsp;as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).&rdquo;

Given binary search tree:&nbsp; root =&nbsp;[6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Note:**

	- All of the nodes&#39; values will be unique.
	- p and q are different and both values will&nbsp;exist in the BST.
