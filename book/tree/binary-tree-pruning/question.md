### 问题描述
We are given the head node `root`&nbsp;of a binary tree, where additionally every node&#39;s value is either a 0 or a 1.

Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.

(Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a descendant of X.)

**Note: **

	- The binary tree&nbsp;will&nbsp;have&nbsp;at&nbsp;most `100 nodes`.
	- The value of each node will only be `0` or `1`.
