### 问题描述
Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.&nbsp; From&nbsp;left to right order, the values of those&nbsp;leaves form a **leaf value sequence.**

<img alt="" src="https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/16/tree.png" style="width: 300px; height: 240px;" />

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is `(6, 7, 4, 9, 8)`.

Two binary trees are considered **leaf-similar**&nbsp;if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are leaf-similar.

&nbsp;

**Note:**

	- Both of the given trees will have between `1` and `100` nodes.
