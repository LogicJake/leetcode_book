### 问题描述
Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value. You need to find the node in the BST that the node&#39;s value equals the given value. Return the subtree rooted with that node. If such node doesn&#39;t exist, you should return NULL.

For example,&nbsp;

You should return this subtree:

In the example above, if we want to search the value `5`, since there is no node with value `5`, we should return `NULL`.
