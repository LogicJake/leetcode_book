### 问题描述

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.



Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.


**Example 1:**<br />
<pre>

    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     <font color="red">3   1</font>
</pre>
Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = <font color="red">3</font> + <font color="red">3</font> + <font color="red">1</font> = **7**.


**Example 2:**<br />

    / \
   <font color="red">4</font>   <font color="red">5</font>

</pre>
Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = <font color="red">4</font> + <font color="red">5</font> = **9**.
