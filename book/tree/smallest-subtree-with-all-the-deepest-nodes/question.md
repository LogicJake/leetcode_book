### 问题描述
Given a binary tree rooted at `root`, the **depth** of each node is the shortest distance to the root.

A node is **deepest** if it has the largest depth possible among&nbsp;any node in the <u>entire tree</u>.

The subtree of a node is that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.

Return the node with the largest depth such that it contains all the deepest nodes in its subtree.

&nbsp;

**Example 1:**

&nbsp;

**Note:**

	- The number of nodes in the tree will be between 1 and 500.
	- The values of each node are unique.
