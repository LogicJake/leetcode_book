### 问题描述
Given a paragraph&nbsp;and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not in the list of banned words.&nbsp; It is guaranteed there is at least one word that isn&#39;t banned, and that the answer is unique.

Words in the list of banned words are given in lowercase, and free of punctuation.&nbsp; Words in the paragraph are not case sensitive.&nbsp; The answer is in lowercase.

&nbsp;

**Example:**

&nbsp;

**Note: **

	- `1 &lt;= paragraph.length &lt;= 1000`.
	- `1 &lt;= banned.length &lt;= 100`.
	- `1 &lt;= banned[i].length &lt;= 10`.
	- The answer is unique, and written in lowercase (even if its occurrences in `paragraph`&nbsp;may have&nbsp;uppercase symbols, and even if it is a proper noun.)
	- `paragraph` only consists of letters, spaces, or the punctuation symbols `!?&#39;,;.`
	- There are no hyphens or hyphenated words.
	- Words only consist of letters, never apostrophes or other punctuation symbols.
