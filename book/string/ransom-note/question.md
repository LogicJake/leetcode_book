Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom 
note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false. 



Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.

You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.
