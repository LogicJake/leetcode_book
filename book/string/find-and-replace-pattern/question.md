### 问题描述
You have a list of&nbsp;`words` and a `pattern`, and you want to know which words in `words` matches the pattern.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters `p` so that after replacing every letter `x` in the pattern with `p(x)`, we get the desired word.

(**Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.**)

Return a list of the words in `words`&nbsp;that match the given pattern.&nbsp;

You may return the answer in any order.

&nbsp;

**Example 1:**

&nbsp;

**Note:**

	- `1 &lt;= words.length &lt;= 50`
	- `1 &lt;= pattern.length = words[i].length&nbsp;&lt;= 20`
