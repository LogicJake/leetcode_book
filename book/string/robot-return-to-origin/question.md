### 问题描述
There is a robot starting at position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot **ends up at (0, 0)** after it completes its moves.

The move sequence is represented by a string, and the character moves[i] represents its ith move. Valid moves are R (right), L (left), U (up), and D (down). If the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, return true. Otherwise, return false.

**Note**: The way that the robot is &quot;facing&quot; is irrelevant. &quot;R&quot; will always make the robot move to the right once, &quot;L&quot; will always make it move left, etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot&#39;s movement is the same for each move.

**Example 1:**
