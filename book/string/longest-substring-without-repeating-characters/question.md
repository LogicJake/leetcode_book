### 问题描述
Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Examples:**

Given `&quot;abcabcbb&quot;`, the answer is `&quot;abc&quot;`, which the length is 3.

Given `&quot;bbbbb&quot;`, the answer is `&quot;b&quot;`, with the length of 1.

Given `&quot;pwwkew&quot;`, the answer is `&quot;wke&quot;`, with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a **substring**, `&quot;pwke&quot;` is a *subsequence* and not a substring.
