### 问题描述
X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from X.&nbsp; Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other; 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.

Now&nbsp;given a positive number `N`, how many numbers X from `1` to `N` are good?

**Note:**

	- N&nbsp; will be in range `[1, 10000]`.
