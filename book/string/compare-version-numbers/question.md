### 问题描述
Compare two version numbers **version1** and **version2**.<br />
If **version1** &gt; **version2** return 1, if **version1** &lt; **version2** return -1, otherwise return 0.

The `.` character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.<br />
For instance, `2.5` is not &quot;two and a half&quot; or &quot;half way to version three&quot;, it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.

Here is an example of version numbers ordering:
