### 问题描述
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

`1` is read off as `&quot;one 1&quot;` or `11`.<br />
`11` is read off as `&quot;two 1s&quot;` or `21`.<br />
`21` is read off as `&quot;one 2`, then `one 1&quot;` or `1211`.

Given an integer *n*&nbsp;where 1 &le; **n** &le; 30, generate the *n*<sup>th</sup> term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
