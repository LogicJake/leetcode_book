### 问题描述
Given a string **s1**, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.

Below is one possible representation of **s1** = `&quot;great&quot;`:

To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.

For example, if we choose the node `&quot;gr&quot;` and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string `&quot;rgeat&quot;`.

We say that `&quot;rgeat&quot;` is a scrambled string of `&quot;great&quot;`.

Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes `&quot;eat&quot;` and `&quot;at&quot;`, it produces a scrambled string `&quot;rgtae&quot;`.

We say that `&quot;rgtae&quot;` is a scrambled string of `&quot;great&quot;`.

Given two strings **s1** and **s2** of the same length, determine if **s2** is a scrambled string of **s1**.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**
