### 问题描述

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.


**Example 1:**<br />
<pre>
**Input:** [1,3,5,4,7]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
</pre>


**Example 2:**<br />
<pre>
**Input:** [2,2,2,2,2]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
</pre>


**Note:**
Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is guaranteed to be fit in 32-bit signed int.
