### 问题描述
Given a non negative integer number **num**. For every numbers **i** in the range **0 &le; i &le; num** calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.



**Example:**</br>
For `num = 5` you should return `[0,1,1,2,1,2]`.



**Follow up:**
<ul>
- It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time **O(n*sizeof(integer))**. But can you do it in linear time **O(n)** /possibly in a single pass?
- Space complexity should be **O(n)**.
- Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like **__builtin_popcount**  in c++ or in any other language.
</ul>
