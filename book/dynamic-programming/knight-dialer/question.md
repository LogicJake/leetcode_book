### 问题描述
A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/knight.png" style="width: 150px; height: 150px;" />&nbsp;.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/30/keypad.png" style="width: 134px; height: 150px;" />

&nbsp;

This time, we place our chess knight on any numbered key of a phone pad (indicated above), and the knight makes `N-1` hops.&nbsp; Each hop must be from one key to another numbered key.

Each time it lands on a key (including the initial placement of the knight), it presses the number of that key, pressing `N` digits total.

How many distinct numbers can you dial in this manner?

Since the answer may be large, **output the answer&nbsp;modulo `10^9 + 7`**.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Example 3:**

&nbsp;

**Note:**

	- `1 &lt;= N &lt;= 5000`
