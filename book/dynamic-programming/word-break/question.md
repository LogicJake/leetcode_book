### 问题描述

Given a **non-empty** string *s* and a dictionary *wordDict* containing a list of **non-empty** words, determine if *s* can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.


For example, given<br>
*s* = `"leetcode"`,<br>
*dict* = `["leet", "code"]`.



Return true because `"leetcode"` can be segmented as `"leet code"`.
