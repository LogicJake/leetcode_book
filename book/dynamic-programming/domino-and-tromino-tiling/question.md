### 问题描述
We have two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino shape, and an &quot;L&quot; tromino shape. These shapes may be rotated.

Given N, how many ways are there to tile a 2 x N board? **Return your answer modulo 10^9 + 7**.

(In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.)

**Note:**

	- N&nbsp; will be in range `[1, 1000]`.
