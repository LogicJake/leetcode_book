### 问题描述
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:**&nbsp;A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,

return its minimum&nbsp;depth = 2.
