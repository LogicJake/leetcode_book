### 问题描述
There are `n` cities connected by&nbsp;`m` flights. Each fight starts from city&nbsp;`u `and arrives at&nbsp;`v` with a price `w`.

Now given all the cities and fights, together with starting city `src` and the destination&nbsp;`dst`, your task is to find the cheapest price from `src` to `dst` with up to `k` stops. If there is no such route, output `-1`.

**Note:**

	- The number of&nbsp;nodes&nbsp;`n` will be&nbsp;in range `[1, 100]`, with nodes labeled from `0` to `n`` - 1`.
	- The&nbsp;size of `flights` will be&nbsp;in range `[0, n * (n - 1) / 2]`.
	- The format of each flight will be `(src, ``dst``, price)`.
	- The price of each flight will be in the range `[1, 10000]`.
	- `k` is in the range of `[0, n - 1]`.
	- There&nbsp;will&nbsp;not&nbsp;be&nbsp;any&nbsp;duplicated&nbsp;flights or&nbsp;self&nbsp;cycles.
