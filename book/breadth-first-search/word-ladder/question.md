### 问题描述
Given two words (**beginWord** and **endWord**), and a dictionary&#39;s word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from **beginWord** to **endWord**, such that:

	1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
	1. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that **beginWord** is **not** a transformed word.

**Note:**

	- Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
	- All words have the same length.
	- All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
	- You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
	- You may assume **beginWord** and **endWord** are non-empty and are not the same.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**
