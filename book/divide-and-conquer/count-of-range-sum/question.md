### 问题描述
Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of range sums that lie in `[lower, upper]` inclusive.<br />
Range sum `S(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the elements in `nums` between indices `i` and `j` (`i` &le; `j`), inclusive.

**Note:**<br />
A naive algorithm of *O*(*n*<sup>2</sup>) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.

**Example:**
