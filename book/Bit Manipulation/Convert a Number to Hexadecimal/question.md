### 问题描述

Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, [two’s complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) method is used.


**Note:**
<ol>
- All letters in hexadecimal (`a-f`) must be in lowercase.
- The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading `0`s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character `'0'`; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
- The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
- You **must not use *any* method provided by the library** which converts/formats the number to hex directly.
